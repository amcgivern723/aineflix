# Aineflix 

# What this project is.
I have created a clone of the famous Netflix. The clone of Netflix also included video controls, preview videos aswell as entities such as TV shows and movies.  Once a user clicks on an entity they will be able to see previews for those entities as well as all the seasons and episodes within that season. A user can also see indications as to whether this you've seen them or not.  When they click on a video, they'll get a video player, which will allow them to actually watch the TV show or movie that they selected.  The website also has features such as searching for entities so users can search for specific things they will then get a list of all the entities which match their search.   The website also has basic account information they can update, such as changing their name, their email address, passwords.  Paypal intergration is also a feature that is featured on this website. This is to allow users to actually purchase subscriptions to our site and pay monthly for our site in orderto actually access these features.
